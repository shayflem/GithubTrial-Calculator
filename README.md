# GithubTrial-Calculator
trial


This project is a trial run that I produced to figure out how Github works.
This was made using the C++ language.
The code is meant to be a calculator application.
The user is meant to enter two values and choose a mathamtical operation to perform.
If anyone happens to use it or look at my code, thank you (You've made me feel very special =) ! )
